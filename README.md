<h1>What is a Chatbot?</h1>
<h4>A chatbot is a computer program that's designed to simulate human conversation. Users communicate with these tools using a chat interface or via voice, just like they would converse with another person. Chatbots interpret the words given to them by a person and provide a pre-set answer.</h4>
<h4>Artificial intelligence, which brings into play machine learning and Natural language Processing (NLP) for building bot or chatbot, is specifically designed to unravel the smooth interaction between humans and computers.</h4>
